        <p>A beach is a narrow, gently sloping strip of land that lies along the edge of an ocean, lake, or river. Materials such as 
        sand, pebbles, rocks, and seashell fragments cover beaches. Most beach materials are the products of weathering and erosion. 
        Over many years, water and wind wear away at the land. The continual action of waves beating against a rocky cliff, for 
        example, may cause some rocks to come loose. Huge boulders can be worn town to tiny grains of sand.</p>

            <p>While we all are a sucker for amazing beaches, many don't know that there are many types of beaches. Travel around the 
            world and you will notice that there isn't just one particular beach type. Walking on white, soft sand, listening to the 
            sound of waves, and is surrounded by scenic views are what contributes to the chilling factor of the ultimate beach 
            destination. Some of the types of beaches are as follows: </p>

                <h2>Sandy Beaches</h2>
                <p>Sandy beaches are the most iconic beach type with sand being the most classic element of the beach. If it weren't 
                for sand, we wouldn't have fun memories of making sandcastles and sand angels. After all, that's what we all so happily 
                associate beaches with.</p>

                <h2>Cave Beaches</h2>
                <p>Sea caves are worth the second glance. We are sure their majestic beauty must make you wonder how they got formed 
                in the first place. Basically, sea caves are created by the wave action of a lake or an ocean. They usually occur in 
                almost every coastal area.</p>

                <h2>Glass Beaches</h2>
                <p>Glass Beach in Fort Bragg, California, is one of the most popular sea glass beaches in the entire world. You will 
                be surprised to know that this beach site was originally a water dump site where people would discard old appliances, 
                glasses, and vehicles too.</p>
